## Overview

Welcome to my R Data Analytics Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects where I applied R programming to solve real-world data problems. These projects span a variety of domains including transportation, finance, biology, and machine learning. The projects involve tasks such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, forecasting, and predictive modeling using popular R packages.

Although the source code for these projects is kept private for confidentiality reasons, this repository includes detailed descriptions of each project, the tools and techniques used, and key highlights. If you are interested in collaborating or reviewing the code, please feel free to contact me.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis
- Data visualization using ggplot2
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Time series forecasting and trend analysis
- Machine learning techniques including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Feature engineering and model tuning
- Cross-validation for predictive model accuracy

## Technologies, Programs, and Tools Used:
- **R**: Primary language for data analysis and modeling.
- **R Libraries/Packages**:
  - dplyr: For data manipulation and wrangling.
  - ggplot2: For creating insightful visualizations.
  - caret: For building and tuning machine learning models.
  - TTR: For time series analysis and forecasting.
  - sqldf: For SQL-like queries on data frames.
  - class: For kNN classification models.
  - lubridate: For working with dates and times.
  - Hmisc: For advanced statistical computations.
- **Data Sources**: Public datasets including flight delay data, wine quality datasets, financial portfolio data, and prostate cancer classification data.

## Projects 

### 1. Flight Departure Delay Analysis
- **Description**: This project analyzes flight delay data by calculating statistics such as the average delay and identifying flights delayed more than an hour. Additional columns are created to identify nighttime and morning flights.
- **Skills Applied**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, conditional column creation.
- **Technologies Used**: R, dplyr, conditional vectorization.
- **Use Case**: Analyzing flight delays to provide insights into peak delay times and trends.

### 2. Wine Quality Analysis
- **Description**: Analysis of the wine quality dataset, which includes calculating the distribution of alcohol content, correlation analysis between residual sugar and alcohol, and identification of outliers based on acidity and sulfates.
- **Skills Applied**: Correlation analysis, outlier detection, data normalization, hypothesis testing.
- **Technologies Used**: R, ggplot2, dplyr, Hmisc.
- **Use Case**: Understanding the relationship between wine quality and different chemical properties.

### 3. Financial Portfolio Forecasting
- **Description**: This project focuses on forecasting financial asset prices using weighted moving averages (WMA). The project also includes a backtesting step to evaluate model performance and seasonality testing to account for potential trends in data.
- **Skills Applied**: Time series forecasting, weighted moving averages, seasonality testing.
- **Technologies Used**: R, TTR, sqldf, ggplot2.
- **Use Case**: Predicting financial asset prices based on historical data, with adjustments for seasonal effects.

### 4. Predictive Modeling using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- **Description**: A machine learning project using the kNN algorithm to classify prostate cancer data. The project involves data normalization, training/validation split, model tuning using cross-validation, and final performance evaluation using confusion matrices.
- **Skills Applied**: Machine learning, feature normalization, model tuning, cross-validation.
- **Technologies Used**: R, caret, class, gmodels, dplyr.
- **Use Case**: Building and fine-tuning a kNN classification model to predict cancer diagnoses based on patient data.

### 5. Descriptive Analytics of Wines
- **Description**: This project performs descriptive analytics on wine data, calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, trimmed mean, and standard deviation for various attributes. It also includes correlation analysis and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables.
- **Skills Applied**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, data visualization.
- **Technologies Used**: R, ggplot2, Hmisc.
- **Use Case**: Providing a detailed statistical overview of wine data to identify key attributes influencing wine quality.
